# synonymous_mutations

Generates synonymous silent mutations given a certain sequence. Will output a random choice each time of the codons that are the furthest away from the original codon.

Will output the changes in uppercase and original sequence in lowercase. Also must provide an input sequence that is a multiple of 3 long.

Needed this to generate mutations at the 5' and 3' ends of the influenza HA coding segement to abolish packaging of the vRNA for the segment.
